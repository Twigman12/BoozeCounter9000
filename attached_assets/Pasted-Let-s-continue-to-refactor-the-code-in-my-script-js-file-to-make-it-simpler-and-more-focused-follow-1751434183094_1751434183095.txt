Let's continue to refactor the code in my script.js file to make it simpler and more focused, following the Single Responsibility Principle.
Our next target is the addItem() function. It currently handles getting user input, validating that input, updating the application's data (state), and triggering multiple UI updates.
Please refactor this function by breaking its responsibilities into smaller, more focused pieces. Here is the desired structure:
1. Create a New, Pure Data/Validation Function:
Name: validateAndPrepareItem(product, quantityString)
Purpose: This function's only job is to validate the inputs and, if they are valid, prepare a new item object. It should not modify any global state or touch the DOM.
Arguments: It should accept two arguments:
product: The currentSelectedProduct object.
quantityString: The raw string value from the quantityInput field.
Logic:
It should perform validation to check if the product object is valid (not null) and if the quantityString can be parsed into a positive number (> 0).
Return Value:
If validation passes, it should create and return a new, fully formed inventory item object: { productId: product.barcode, productName: product.name, quantity: parseFloat(quantityString) }.
If validation fails, it should return null.
2. Create a New Controller Function (to replace addItem):
Name: handleAddItem()
Purpose: This function will act as a simple orchestrator or controller. Its job is to manage the flow between getting data, validating it, and updating the state and UI.
Logic:
It should get the currentSelectedProduct global variable and the string value from the quantityInput field.
It should call our new validateAndPrepareItem() function, passing in the product and quantity string.
It should then use an if/else statement to check the result:
If validateAndPrepareItem() returns a valid newItem object (i.e., not null):
It should push the newItem object to the inventoryItems array.
It should call saveSessionToLocalStorage(inventoryItems) (if you've implemented this).
It should call renderInventoryList() to update the UI.
Finally, it should call resetInputFlow() to reset the UI for the next entry.
Else (if the result is null):
It should call the showToast() function (from our previous refactor) with an appropriate error message, like 'Invalid product or quantity.', and the type 'error'.
3. Update the Event Listeners:
Task: Please find the existing event listeners for the #add-item-btn button (on 'click') and the #quantity-input field (on 'keypress' for 'Enter').
Action: Update both of these event listeners so that they now call the new handleAddItem() controller function instead of the old addItem function.
Please apply this complete refactoring to the existing script.js code. The goal is to have the same application functionality but with a much cleaner, more maintainable, and more testable code structure.
